# postlightmercury 1.1

* Added a `NEWS.md` file to track changes to the package.
* Re-wrote the `webparser()` so it uses the `crul` package instead. This allows for asynchronous requests.
* Added the helper function `null_to_na()` to replace NULLs with NAs when converting lists to data frames.
* Added codecoverage
